# HELLO java WORLD
## Java-getting started why?

Getting started with any language is hard, and java is no special case. <br>
For this purpose I have started the java-getting started for myself. 

Here I will keep and create simple java projects that explore java's functionality and quirks. <br> 

I have given every folder an explicit name hoping that if you were to look for implementations of specific functionality, you can just take a peek inside the folder and explore how to implement this in java.
